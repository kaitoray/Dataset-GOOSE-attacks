Malicious behaviour:

Network level: The GOOSE payload of IED_TRSF1 is modified from (0101) to (1110, open open CB1_66KV and CB_TRSF1, close CB2-22KV) to physcial process (Simulink) if a short circuit happens around transformer2.

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens around transformer2, (CB1_66KV, CB2_66KV, CB3_66KV, CB_TRSF1, CB_TRSF2) will be opened, (CB2_22KV) will be closed to isolate the fault, both transformer1 and transformer2 no longer provides any power load.
