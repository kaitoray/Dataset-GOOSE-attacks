Malicious behaviour:

Network level: Except the benign behaviours, IED_TRSF1 will also inject Pub_TRSF1 (0101) when a short-circuit happens around TRSF1, publish both open and close CB commands simultaneously with the same heartbeat while close CB commands (malicious) always after the open commands (benign).

Physical process level:If a short circuit happens around transformer1, (CB1_66KV, CB_TRSF1, CB2_22KV) will be switching between closing and opening respectively. Over current protection fails.
